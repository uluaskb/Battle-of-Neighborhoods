    "## A. Introduction :\n",
    "\n",
    "   Trying to make a move to London with pets will require good planning and some research. London is a sprawling metropolis and whilst all the main tourist attractions are fairly close to each other, the surrounding areas make for a large and, to those who’re not familiar with the city, somewhat confusing location. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many rental properties do not accept pets; pet-friendly rentals in London are limited and tend to get snapped up pretty quickly. In order to succeed in your search you need to focus on certain neighbourhoods.\n",

    "## B. Objective: \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project my objective is to segment areas of London based on the below criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Park within 500 meter\n",
    "* Supermarket within 500 meter  \n",
    "* Commuting duration to Bank station\n",
    "* Crime rates\n",
    "* Rent prices\n",

    "### Location\n",
    "The first thing to understand about London is how the different areas are described.  There are **33** boroughs of London, each with their own infrastructure, local government, council and highly individual feel and identity.  These boroughs are then further broken down into what are known as ‘**postcodes**’.  Each postcode begins with one or two letters, followed by a one or two digit number.  This code identifies a particular area within a borough, and is then followed by another number-letter-letter combination that identifies a particular area in a street.\n",
